### Domain: Responsible AI
### Question 1
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because one of the key risks associated
with GitHub Copilot is its potential to generate insecure or vulnerable code. Since it
draws from public training data, some suggestions might not follow modern security
practices, and developers might unknowingly accept them without review, leading to risks
in production systems.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because although outdated syntax can
occasionally appear, most modern IDEs and tools will flag such issues. This is more of a
minor usability inconvenience than a critical risk in production. So this shouldn’t be
an actual security-related concern.

- **Option C is INCORRECT,** as open-source code licensing concerns
are real but secondary to the immediate security implications of introducing
AI-generated code. GitHub has taken steps to address this by filtering output and
including references where possible.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because reduced creativity is a
subjective and long-term concern, not a tangible production-level risk. Developers can
still make design decisions and override Copilot’s suggestions at any
point.**

### Domain: Responsible AI
### Question 2
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because Copilot is trained on a vast
amount of data, which is publicly available; this data may include the biased, outdated,
or incorrect practices of code implementation. This typically highlights a key concern
in Responsible AI.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because no AI tool, including Copilot,
guarantees completely error-free, flawless code. Its responses depend on the Prompt
quality and training data, which can act as the key factors to impact optimal code
suggestions.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** as responsible use of AI tools mandates
continued adherence to software engineering best practices. Among which, Software
testing plays a crucial role in determining code durability. So, software testing cannot
be completely replaced with AI.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot can only function when
you have an active internet connection, by working offline it could not analyze or fetch
any information from the LLMs. So, this option is not practical in general.

### Domain: Responsible AI
### Question 3
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because responsible AI operation involves
transparency, oversight, and security. By enforcing human review and applying security
best practices, teams can ensure responsible AI operation and Accountability.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because committing a block of code
without proper review violates the principles of the Responsible AI. It could apparently
lead to production risk as well if the code is flawed or insecure.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** as Copilot can only assist in
generating the unit tests. Relying completely on its suggestions without any further
validations is a high-risk approach and can contradict responsible AI practices.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because by removing the manual
intervention, the organization will prioritize speed over reliability, safety and
accountability. It directly misaligns with the principles of responsible
AI.**

### Domain: Responsible AI
### Question 4
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because generative AI systems like GitHub
Copilot are trained on vast amounts of publicly available data, it may raise one of the
key concerns with generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot which may lack TRANSPARENCY in
how code suggestions are being generated. Developers may not understand whether
suggestions are derived from biased patterns or datasets which are not assessed for
ensuring FAIRNESS. So, this option correctly points towards the key risks of using AI
generated suggestions directly in your code.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because generative AI tools do not
inherently enforce the privacy controls, code suggestions might resemble the content
from the public repositories which needs proper filtering or safeguarding of data to
avoid exposing sensitive logic or data.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because although github Copilot doesn’t
intentionally return the code suggestions with any form of bias, the training data which
it uses might contain some biased info. So, it’s incorrect to assume that AI generated
code is free from any kind of bias.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** as GitHub Copilot might help with the
code suggestions but cannot automatically provide the comprehensive documentation for
its output unless specifically requested by the user via their prompt.

### Domain: Responsible AI
### Question 5
**Correct Answers: A, B and E**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because TRANSPARENCY is a key component
of ethical AI. It ensures stakeholders can trace how AI makes decisions and be
accountable for suggestions that it generates.

- **Option B is CORRECT** as PRIVACY and SECURITY are essential for
protecting the sensitive user information and ensuring AI systems are secure and also
respects the user's privacy.

- **Option E is CORRECT** as promoting FAIRNESS and reducing bias helps prevent discrimination and
welcomes people from all groups of society without considering any kind of
differentiators.

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 6
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Enterprise
includes support for private Knowledge Bases, which enables integration of internal
documentation, best practices, and custom code snippets. It also supports
enterprise-grade governance, security, and policy enforcement features—ideal for large
organizations.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because Copilot Individual is meant for
personal use and lacks organizational control, governance, or Knowledge Base support.
That’s why this couldn't address the given requirement.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot Business supports
policy management and GitHub Copilot Chat but does not support private Knowledge Bases,
which are essential for internal code customization.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because although it supports non-GitHub
repositories, it doesn't provide enterprise-specific features like internal
documentation linking or Knowledge Bases. That’s why GitHub Copilot for Enterprises will
be the correct plan to go with for the given requirement.

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 7
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Business supports
usage with non-GitHub repositories. Developers can use Copilot in supported IDEs
regardless of the repository hosting platform, enabling access to AI coding suggestions
even if code is hosted outside GitHub.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because although the early versions of
Copilot were closely tied to GitHub-hosted code, GitHub Copilot Business has expanded
support to include non-GitHub repositories. So this option is not correct.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because migrating code to GitHub is not
required. This option reflects an outdated assumption. That’s why this choice is not
valid.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because the GitHub Copilot CLI is
platform-agnostic and doesn't require GitHub-hosted code. It's designed to work locally
and assist with shell commands, regardless of code host.

**Reference:**

- [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-Copilot-management-and-customizations/2-explore-github-Copilot-plans-associated-management-customization-features?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.github-Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-copilot-management-and-customizations/2-explore-github-copilot-plans-associated-management-customization-features?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.github-copilot)

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 8
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot in IDEs like VS
Code works by analyzing the surrounding code and developer comments in real-time. It
uses this context to suggest relevant completions, often inline as you type.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** as Copilot does not rely on static
templates. Instead, it generates code dynamically based on AI models. So, this is not a
general behavior of GitHub Copilot.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because although Copilot does consider
the current file’s content, it also uses broader context, such as comments and imported
libraries, not just previously written lines.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot provides inline
code suggestions and doesn’t depend solely on command palette inputs. So this option
cannot be the right answer.

**References:**

- [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github-Copilot/3-interacting-with-Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github-copilot/3-interacting-with-copilot)

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 9
**Correct Answers: A, B, C and E**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot is designed to
monitor developer input in real time. When a user writes a comment or starts typing
code, Copilot predicts the intent and generates relevant suggestions inline. This method
is particularly useful for quickly completing code blocks or writing repetitive logic.

- **Option B is CORRECT** because Copilot Chat allows users to ask
natural language questions directly in their IDE. This is useful for getting
explanations, asking for code snippets, or even requesting refactoring suggestions — all
within a conversational UI powered by generative AI.

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot supports the
ability to trigger multiple suggestions at once. For example, by using shortcuts like
Ctrl + Enter in Visual Studio Code, developers can cycle through multiple completions,
improving the quality of the final code by choosing the most suitable option.

- **Option E is CORRECT** because the GitHub Copilot CLI allows
users to leverage Copilot’s assistance directly from the terminal. It can generate shell
commands, explain terminal errors, or help write automation scripts, making it a
powerful tool for command-line-focused developers.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because while Copilot can assist in
writing deployment scripts or commands, it cannot deploy applications or interact with
production environments autonomously. Deployments require deliberate, secure actions
that go beyond Copilot's AI-assisted coding scope.

**References:**

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 10
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Individual offers
context-aware suggestions directly in the IDE, helping developers by predicting and
completing code based on the current file and surrounding context.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because organization-wide policy
settings and audit logs are only available in GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise
plans, not in the Individual tier. Individual users manage Copilot settings on a
personal level without admin or policy control.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because Knowledge Bases are part of the
Copilot Enterprise offering. These allow organizations to integrate internal
documentation and best practices, which is not available to Individual users.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Individual does
not support GHE (GitHub Enterprise Server) integration. That feature is exclusive to
Copilot Enterprise users who require enhanced security and internal codebase
referencing.

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 11
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot supports the
“.Copilotignore” file, which allows users to explicitly exclude files or folders from
being considered as context for suggestions and from being used for future model
improvements. This is the appropriate way to protect proprietary code.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because .gitignore only prevents files
from being tracked in Git version control; it does not prevent Copilot from reading or
learning from those files.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because disabling Copilot entirely
stops all suggestions across the workspace, which is unnecessary if only certain files
need to be excluded.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not recognize
in-file comments as exclusion instructions. This would have no effect on whether the
file is included in training data.

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 12
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot policy management
can be done at the organization or enterprise level via the GitHub Enterprise settings.
Admins can either enable or disable the Copilot features and assign access controls to
teams and users based on the actual requirement. This will ensure consistent
governance/management across the organization.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because asking the individual
developers to configure settings in their self managed IDE’s introduces inconsistency
and does not align with the centralized governance strategy. This strategy cannot be
brought into action, to ensure centralized governance, access controls must be performed
at the organization level.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because “.copilot ignore” file is used
to exclude some specific files or path which you don’t want to be accessed by the GitHub
Copilot while generating code suggestions. It doesn’t have any control over the policy
management or access provisioning across an organization.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because “.github/settings.yml” is a
Repository level settings file which is useful for the automation and configuration of
GitHub settings but does not have capability to control organization or an
enterprise-wide policy management.

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 13
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because organization audit logs are
primarily used to track administrative actions such as enabling or disabling GitHub
Copilot, identifying the user who performed the action, and the timestamp. This promotes
accountability, transparency, and security compliance.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because while GitHub tracks activity
related to suggestions, the audit logs specifically focus on administrative actions and
not the acceptance or rejection of individual code suggestions.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not provide
real-time debugging support. It provides AI-based code suggestions but not direct
debugging.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because pull request summaries are a
separate feature and not part of audit logs. Audit logs do not generate summaries, they
record administrative actions.

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 14
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Enterprise
provides a feature called pull request summaries. This feature uses generative AI to
automatically generate concise and readable summaries of the changes made in a pull
request. This significantly helps reviewers quickly understand the context and scope of
the updates made by a pull request. This makes the code-review process more efficient.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat provides
context-aware AI Assistance to developers within their Local development environments
(IDE’s). It can answer questions, help you fix the bugs, generate code explanations or
even suggest any possible improvements in an interactive and contextual way. However
this feature does not directly help in the context of code review workflows or
summarizing the pull requests.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot CLI is a command
line tool that helps developers perform some basic tasks like initiating code generation
and implement terminal commands using AI, but does not have capabilities of generating
any summaries or documentation of pull requests. Hence this is not a valid choice.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because inline code suggestions are
part of Copilot’s core functionality in IDEs. These suggestions are useful while coding
in realtime in the IDE, but are unrelated to summarizing pull requests.

**References:**

- [https://docs.github.com/en/Copilot/using-github-Copilot/using-github-Copilot-for-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-summary-with-github-Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-summary-with-github-copilot)

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 15
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Enterprise allows
organizations to create and configure Knowledge Bases containing internal code snippets,
documentation, best practices, and more. These resources are used by Copilot to provide
contextually relevant suggestions based on proprietary content.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat provides
conversational support, but it requires a Knowledge Base to give custom,
organization-specific responses.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because the GitHub Copilot CLI is used
for command-line suggestions and operations, not for managing organizational knowledge.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because audit logs track administrative
actions and usage but are unrelated to customizing Copilot suggestions using internal
data.

**References:**

- [https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/Copilot/customizing-Copilot/managing-Copilot-knowledge-bases](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/customizing-copilot/managing-copilot-knowledge-bases)

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 16
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because a well-maintained GitHub Copilot
Enterprise Knowledge Base should be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect
continuously evolving internal practices, standards, and architectures. This ensures the
suggestions generated remain useful and contextually accurate for the development team.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because by replacing the Knowledge Base
entirely each month is inefficient and risks losing important institutional knowledge.
The goal is to gradually update the data to meet the company’s standards but not
completely wipe and rebuild it.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** as GitHub Copilot Enterprise does not
directly ingest data automatically from the Public repositories in an organization,
unless explicitly configured. So, this action is not required.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because while the suggestions of developers is a valuable input,
but, there’s no direct way for developers to submit their suggestions for Knowledge Base
from their IDE. Updates should be managed by the concerned persons who are managing and
updating the documentation.**
**

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 17
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat excels at
providing context-aware assistance directly within the developer’s IDE. When a developer
asks a question about a function, class, or logic in their codebase, Copilot Chat can
interpret the context and offer accurate, helpful responses, such as explanations of
what a piece of code does, how to refactor it, or how to fix an error. This makes it
particularly effective for in-the-moment learning and debugging during software
development.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because while GitHub Copilot offers a
feature for pull request summaries, this is not handled through the Copilot Chat
interface. It is a distinct functionality tied to the GitHub pull request workflow, not
conversational support.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because organization-wide access
controls are managed through GitHub's administrative settings, typically by organization
owners or administrators, not via Copilot Chat.

- **Option D is
INCORRECT** because repository audit logs are part of GitHub’s administrative
and security monitoring tools. These logs are not accessible or queried using Copilot
Chat and are outside its scope.**
**

**References:**

- [https://docs.github.com/en/Copilot/about-github-Copilot/what-is-github-Copilot#Copilot-features](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#copilot-features)

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 18
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because the accuracy and usefulness of
GitHub Copilot Chat responses are highly influenced by how clear and specific the
developer’s prompts are. Providing concise, direct questions and especially when the
relevant code is visible in the IDE. This helps Copilot Chat interpret the developer’s
intent and deliver high-quality, context-aware answers. This mirrors the best practices
for using any conversational AI effectively, especially in a development environment.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because the visual theme of the IDE,
such as dark or light mode, is purely a user preference and has no direct impact on
Copilot Chat’s response generation or quality.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because while too many extensions might
affect overall IDE performance, it does not directly influence the quality or accuracy
of Copilot Chat’s suggestions or responses. It purely refers to an operational
constraint.

- **Option D is
INCORRECT** because comments can actually improve Copilot’s contextual
understanding. Including explanatory comments in code can help the AI interpret purpose
and logic better, especially when handling complex functions or legacy code.**

### Domain: GitHub Copilot plans and features
### Question 19
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because to install GitHub Copilot in the
CLI, developers must first have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed. Then, they run the
correct command: gh extension install github/gh-Copilot. Authentication is completed
with gh auth login. This sequence ensures the extension is installed properly and
securely.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot CLI is not installed
via npm, and repository creation is unrelated to setup.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because GitHub Desktop and marketplace
installations are not relevant to CLI usage.

- **Option D is
INCORRECT** since this describes installing Copilot in an IDE (like VS Code),
not in the command-line interface.**

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 20
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is correct** because when the user writes a prompt and
shares it with GitHub to get support, the proxy server acts as an intermediary layer
between the user and GitHub Copilot, filtering Copilot’s responses to ensure they comply
with security policies and do not expose sensitive or proprietary information. This
post-processing step helps maintain responsible AI use by preventing potentially harmful
code from being suggested.

- **Option B is inCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not
explicitly store the user data unless prompted by the user. This ensures that users'
information stays private and also avoids revealing any Personally Identifiable
Information (PII).

- **Option C is incorrect** as Developers are not directly
authorized to perform any actions or access the AI Model’s underlying data. The AI model
is trained on a large public dataset and internal proprietary data controlled by
GitHub/Microsoft.

- **Option D is inCORRECT** because the primary focus of the proxy
server is to act as a filter and content moderator, ensuring compliance with rules and
following security guidelines. This server cannot directly help with the caching or
storing of any data in the local machines.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 21
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot uses a similarity
algorithm to compare its generated code suggestions against a reference index of public
code on GitHub. When a suggestion has a high similarity to a known public repository, it
is flagged to help developers identify reused code and maintain compliance with
licensing or originality standards. Additionally, from a user's point of view, you can
also opt to block matching public code.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not
specifically scan users’ local repositories for match validation. It generates
suggestions based on the context of the prompt provided by the user, but not
repository-wide scanning.

- **Option C is INCORRECT,** as although GitHub Copilot relies on
pre-trained data for content generation, it does perform the post-generation checks
before delivering the results to the user, which includes checking for the matching
public code as well.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot always follows a
suggestion review system, which works in a completely automated workflow and doesn’t
rely on manual validation from any of its teams. So this option is not correct.

**Reference:**

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 22
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Individual
includes privacy settings that allow users like Alex to opt in or out of allowing their
code snippets and interactions to be used to improve GitHub Copilot models. This ensures
transparency and user control over how data is handled. These settings can be configured
from the GitHub account privacy settings.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does collect
telemetry and usage data unless users opt out. This includes details like code
completion events and usage patterns, which help improve the user experience. That’s why
users must opt out if they wish to avoid data sharing with GitHub Copilot for
fine-tuning.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** as GitHub Copilot does not publicly
share user code by default. Even when users opt in to sharing data for model
improvement, this data is anonymized and securely handled. GitHub respects developer
confidentiality and ensures privacy.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot requires an
internet connection to function and performs code completions through cloud services. It
does not run fully offline or encrypt suggestions locally in the IDE. Additionally,
GitHub Copilot does require an active internet connection to communicate with its server
for generating the code suggestions. So, this option is invalid.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 23
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot works by securely
sending the real-time code context through a private connection from the developer’s IDE
to a cloud-hosted AI model, which is present in GitHub's Backend. The model processes
the input using a trained transformer and returns context-aware code suggestions, all
within milliseconds. This allows developers to receive intelligent, in-flow suggestions
tailored to their current work.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not rely
solely on local keyword matching or caching; it requires access to a cloud-based model
for intelligent completions. That’s why external communication is a mandate.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as GitHub Copilot doesn’t require
uploading the entire project or using predefined templates; only the relevant code or
code block that surrounds the cursor is sent to the server for further processing.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not have
any real-time capability to check all the public repositories on GitHub. It basically
relies on a pre-trained model, which is powered by a broad dataset.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 24
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat works by
collecting the prompt text entered by the user, along with contextual metadata from the
editor, such as the cursor position, selected code, and surrounding lines of code. This
information is securely sent to GitHub Copilot’s backend through a proxy service, where
it is processed by the language model to generate a relevant and contextual response.
This enables Copilot Chat to assist in use cases like "Explain this code", "Refactor
this", or "Suggest test cases", based on the exact code the developer is working on.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat does not
have any local library of templates. So, it does not rely on local templates for dynamic
code generation. So this option cannot be a valid choice.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as the model is not present anywhere in
the local and does all the processing through a cloud-hosted interface and completely
relies on the server-side processing. So, this option is incorrect both technically and
contextually.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because responses are not generated by
matching the prompt with public repository discussions on GitHub; it depends on the
language models instead for generating the code suggestions.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 25
**Correct Answers: A, D and E**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat can read code
in context (including what is selected or where the cursor is placed) and explain its
logic in simple, natural language.

- **Option D is CORRECT** as GitHub Copilot Chat is designed to
handle refactor prompts, like turning long functions into reusable components or
optimizing code readability. Users can accept or reject those suggestions.

- **Option E is CORRECT** because one of the key capabilities of
GitHub Copilot Chat is test generation. It can suggest unit tests for selected methods
or entire classes based on code context.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because although GitHub Copilot Chat
can suggest debugging strategies, it doesn't integrate with debuggers or track variable
state at runtime. It can help reason about bugs but doesn’t replace a debugging tool.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Chat does not
execute code or shell scripts. It can suggest commands or scripts, but the execution
must happen externally by the developer.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 26
**Correct Answers: B and D**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because Copilot’s underlying model (based
on large language models like Codex or GPT) was trained on a wide range of publicly
available code from GitHub. As such, it learned common idioms, function structures, and
library usage patterns. Tasks like sorting lists, manipulating strings, or formatting
dates have many similar examples, so Copilot is more likely to suggest such “most seen”
patterns.

- **Option D is CORRECT** because Copilot works based on a
predictive approach. It does not recall exact examples but uses learned patterns to
predict the next most likely token or code snippet. Therefore, the more common a code
structure is in public repositories, the more likely it is to appear in Copilot’s
suggestions.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not memorize or
reproduce user-specific or proprietary code unless explicitly provided in context (e.g.,
via a Knowledge Base in Copilot for Enterprise). It uses generalization, not
memorization, as part of responsible AI development.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as Copilot does not auto-index
organizational codebases unless part of Copilot for Enterprise with a configured
Knowledge Base. Even then, it does not generate “universal standards” but rather uses
available patterns to assist with context-aware suggestions.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 27
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot is trained on a
large volume of publicly available code from repositories, which may include outdated or
unsupported libraries. As the training data is not continuously refreshed in real time,
some suggestions may reflect older practices unless curated or updated manually.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot cannot update its
knowledge base in real time. Its training data is static for a given release cycle and
does not automatically include the latest commits or library versions.

- **Option C is INCORRECT**, as Copilot does not directly filter
out deprecated libraries during the training. The model learns from all the code that is
available in its training data, regardless of its age or relevance.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot is not just
limited to the user’s repositories. It is trained on a big set of training data, which
aligns with a much broader data set of public codebases. By doing so, it becomes able to
generate tailored suggestions by taking advantage of its large code knowledge base.

### Domain: How GitHub Copilot works and handles data
### Question 28
**Correct Answers: A and C**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not compute
results like a calculator or logic engine. Instead, it generates code based on
statistical patterns it has learned from vast amounts of source code in its training
data.

- **Option C is CORRECT** since Copilot can often appear to reason
due to the rich variety of examples it has seen during training. This is more like
pattern replication than true reasoning or analytical thinking. This code may look clean
and error-free at first glance, but it still requires human review to ensure accuracy.

- **Option B is INCORRECT,** as Copilot is not designed to perform
as a dedicated calculator or theorem solver. It may offer relevant suggestions and can
also produce solutions that look accurate, but it does not guarantee the correctness of
the mathematical calculations.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot tries to understand the
human’s intent through NLP. But it cannot completely execute real-time logical analysis
for every prompt. That is why a thorough review of each response generated by Copilot is
mandatory.

- [Limited scope of GitHub Copilot chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-chat-in-github#limitations-of-github-copilot-chat)

### Domain: Prompt Crafting and Prompt Engineering
### Question 29
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot determines the
context of a prompt primarily based on the surrounding code, including recent lines
typed, file contents, file names, and other open files in the workspace. This contextual
awareness helps Copilot to generate relevant and intelligent code completions,
especially for tasks like writing functions, tests, or even while generating any
documentation.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because using only the last keyword
would severely limit Copilot's understanding. It cannot understand the actual context
just from a small word. So, Copilot uses a larger context window that includes several
lines before and after the prompt.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as Copilot does not use personal
internet history for suggestions. This is a traditional example of violating responsible
AI principles. GitHub Copilot operates strictly within the context of the development
environment to ensure privacy and relevance.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot's suggestions are not
random. They are statistically derived predictions based on its training and the
prompt's context. This predictive approach helps the copilot to generate suggestions by
making use of learning patterns and its wide knowledge base.

### Domain: Prompt Crafting and Prompt Engineering
### Question 30
**Correct Answers: A, C and D**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot is trained to
understand natural language prompts, especially in English. Users can describe intent in
plain English comments and Copilot will generate relevant code according to their
requirements.

- **Option C is CORRECT** because Copilot intelligently uses naming
conventions, indentation, and surrounding code context (like function and variable
names) to generate suggestions.

- **Option D is CORRECT** as GitHub Copilot supports prompting and
code generation in many major languages such as Python, Go, TypeScript, C#, Java, and
Shell scripting.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot works with a wide array
of languages beyond JavaScript, including Python, TypeScript, Java, Ruby, and more.

- **Option E is INCORRECT** because Developers do not need to
specify the target language explicitly in each comment. Copilot uses file type, syntax,
and context to understand the appropriate language.

**References:**

### Domain: Prompt Crafting and Prompt Engineering
### Question 31
**Correct Answers: A, B, C, and D**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because this is essential. A clear
description helps Copilot understand the intent of the code. It sets the context and
guides the model toward the correct logic.

- **Option B is CORRECT**, because providing examples or
constraints helps Copilot understand edge cases, expected behavior, and how the function
should respond to different inputs.

- **Option C is CORRECT** because Descriptive names like username,
password, or isValid help Copilot infer the purpose of each variable and generate more
accurate code.

- **Option D is CORRECT,** because starting with a function
signature or partial code gives Copilot a structural hint and narrows down the scope of
generation.

- **Option E is INCORRECT** because this is counterproductive.
Shortening prompts by using unclear or generic variable names reduces Copilot’s ability
to generate meaningful and secure code.

**References:**

### Domain: Prompt Crafting and Prompt Engineering
### Question 32
**Correct Answers: A and B**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because effective prompting plays a
foundational role in guiding Copilot toward understanding what the user wants, ensuring
the generated suggestions are contextually relevant and align with the expectations of
the users of Copilot.

- **Option B is CORRECT** because Precise, well-crafted prompts
reduce confusion, which directly improves the quality and usability of the AI’s
suggestions. That’s why it's important to ensure that your prompt contains all the
information that correctly helps Copilot to take the accurate direction for generating
suggestions.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as GitHub Copilot does not access
private repositories unless specifically configured by the user, prompting doesn’t
override access policies. So, this choice is not valid.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because while good prompts help reduce
manual effort, they do not eliminate the need for external documentation or
understanding of the codebase. So, it's equally important to ensure the correctness of
the other processes as well.

### Domain: Prompt Crafting and Prompt Engineering
### Question 33
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because this option is not contextually
correct and only incorrect claims among the remaining options. Few-shot prompting does
not fine-tune or change the model. It only influences output during that prompt session
to make them more aligned with your requirements; there is no live model adjustment or
training during the few-shot prompting process.

- **Option A is INCORRECT.** Few-shot prompting intentionally
includes a few relevant examples within the prompt to guide the model toward producing
the desired output. This technique helps Copilot or any language model understand the
expected structure or format. Therefore, stating that few-shot prompting uses examples
is contextually accurate and does not make the option incorrect.

- **Option B is INCORRECT**, as Zero-shot prompting relies on the
model's pretrained knowledge without providing any examples in the prompt. It simply
asks the model to respond to a task based on its general language and domain
understanding. Since this is a fundamental and accurate definition, this option is also
contextually correct, not incorrect.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because by showing examples, few-shot
prompting helps Copilot generate outputs that are better aligned with the user’s intent.
This plays an essential role in a few shot prompting strategy.

**Important Note: **During the examination, always make sure that
you read the question well and understand which choice the problem is asking you to choose.
The exam might try to trick you into choosing the incorrect option among the provided
statements, but you end up choosing the correct choice because of our regular habit of
pointing out only the correct answer among the given set of options. It is best to read each
question twice and do a final check always before the submission.

### Domain: Developer use cases for AI
### Question 34
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot enhances developer
productivity by:

- Providing real-time code suggestions tailored to
unfamiliar languages or frameworks, easing the learning curve.

- Translating comments or snippets from one natural language
to another, facilitating global collaboration.

- Helping developers stay in flow during context switching
between modules by offering context-aware completions and reducing the time spent
recalling syntax or logic.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because While GitHub Copilot may assist
in writing test cases or identifying code patterns, it does not fully automate testing
or debugging. Developer input is still essential.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as Copilot suggests code flexibly based
on best practices and context, it doesn't restrict developers or enforce syntax
strictly. It only follows the input provided by the user to generate code suggestions.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because AI tools like GitHub Copilot
are basically assistive in nature, not replacements for documentation, onboarding, or
human communication. So, this option is not correct.

### Domain: Developer use cases for AI
### Question 35
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot acts like an AI
pair programmer by offering relevant, context-aware code suggestions and completions
based on the new language and framework. This helps the developer understand patterns
and syntax while they write code, accelerating learning through practical examples
rather than theory alone.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not enforce rules
or block code. It provides suggestions, but developers can accept, modify, or ignore
them. It encourages exploration rather than restricting creativity or learning.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** as while Copilot reduces the need to
constantly check documentation, it doesn’t eliminate the importance of official learning
resources, tutorials, or understanding core concepts. It is a helpful assistant, but
cannot act as a full replacement for structured learning.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not perform
automated language translation or codebase conversion at scale. Such tasks require
specialized tools and careful human review to avoid errors.

### Domain: Developer use cases for AI
### Question 36
**Correct Answer: B **

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot helps boost
developer productivity as it supports a wide range of programming languages. This helps
in bridging the knowledge gap between implementing the various programming languages.
Copilot can help provide python suggestions while trying to migrate from the Java
programming language.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because Copilot doesn’t restrict
language boundaries. It supports language-agnostic environments and supports developers
working with multiple programming languages simultaneously.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** as Copilot does not directly replace
any files directly without the involvement of the developer. It’s an assistive tool, not
an autonomous code converter. Developer input and review are essential.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not block
suggestions in multi-language environments. Instead, it continues to provide relevant
completions based on surrounding context, even if multiple programming languages are
involved.

### Domain: Developer use cases for AI
### Question 37
**Correct Answer: C**

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot uses the context
of the current file and nearby code to generate smart suggestions, even when switching
between different languages, files, or frameworks. It helps developers stay "in the
zone" by reducing the mental effort needed to remember function signatures, repeat
patterns, or re-read other parts of the code. This significantly minimizes the total
load caused by frequent context switching.

- **Option A is INCORRECT.** Copilot does not restrict user
interaction or freeze the development environment. It enhances developer fluidity by
allowing smooth transitions between files or components while offering helpful
suggestions based on the current and nearby context. Freezing the editor would disrupt
productivity rather than enhance it, which is not aligned with the principles of
Copilot's purpose.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** as GitHub Copilot does not merge or
rewrite codebases from multiple languages into a single language. It is designed to
support multilingual environments, allowing developers to work with different languages
(like JavaScript, Python, HTML, etc.) efficiently. Copilot respects the structure of
multi-language projects and aids productivity by offering relevant code in each
language’s syntax.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot doesn’t limit itself
strictly to the current line or file. It uses available context such as function
headers, prior code in the file, and developer behavior to generate accurate
predictions. It helps maintain consistency and relevance even when switching between
related files or modules, making it more effective during full-stack or cross-functional
development.**

### Domain: Developer use cases for AI
### Question 38
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT.** GitHub Copilot provides intelligent,
context-aware suggestions across several phases of the SDLC. During development, it
autocompletes logic, writes boilerplate, and offers syntax help. For testing, it can
suggest unit test cases and help create mocks or fixtures. During documentation, it
auto-generates docstrings and inline comments based on code context. This comprehensive
support boosts developer efficiency and reduces repetitive effort across the lifecycle.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because Copilot is not limited to
project initialization. It continuously supports coding activities, whether it’s
refactoring logic, writing new features, or documenting code. Its capabilities span
beyond just setup and into all key stages of development.

- **Option C is INCORRECT,** as Copilot is an assistive tool and
not a replacement for developers. It accelerates routine tasks and reduces
context-switching, but human expertise is still needed for decision-making,
architecture, code reviews, and debugging.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because while Copilot can assist in
scripting and automation, its primary strengths lie in helping developers write and
improve code during active development and testing. It does not focus solely on
deployment or offer a limited script repository.

**References:**

### Domain: Testing with GitHub Copilot
### Question 39
**Correct Answers: A, C and D**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot can autocomplete
full unit test functions when it detects structured inputs such as descriptive comments,
function names, or docstrings. This helps developers quickly scaffold and refine test
cases without having to write them from scratch.

- **Option C is CORRECT** as Copilot can analyse multiple code
components and suggest boilerplate for integration tests, especially when developers
prompt with comments that mention two or more interacting modules. This accelerates
multi-module validation.

- **Option D is CORRECT** because Copilot can learn from past test
patterns in the codebase (e.g., how test functions are structured or named) and suggest
new test cases aligned with those patterns. This speeds up the generation of repetitive
tests for similar functions.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not automatically
identify flaky tests (Unpredictable tests that fail intermittently without code changes)
or fix them without any developer intervention. Flaky test resolution typically involves
runtime analysis, which is outside Copilot's static context generation capabilities.

### Domain: Testing with GitHub Copilot
### Question 40
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot can generate
intelligent test case suggestions by analysing the logic of a function and interpreting
developer-written comments. For example, if a developer adds a comment like “test for
empty input" or “check for negative discount values”, Copilot uses this contextual hint
to suggest corresponding test cases. Additionally, based on its training data, it can
produce likely boundary conditions and edge scenarios, helping teams catch errors that
would typically be missed in regular testing.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because Copilot cannot execute code or
identify failed input scenarios through dynamic runtime analysis. It is a code
completion tool, not a test runner or debugger. So this is not a possible scenario.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because although Copilot depends on its
training data for generating suggestions, its suggestions are not limited to examples
from its training data. It generalises patterns and is capable of adapting to new logic
and contexts based on user prompts and current file content.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot can assist in
generating useful test cases, but it doesn’t eliminate the developer’s role. A complete,
high-quality test suite still requires human intervention, especially for
domain-specific validation, edge case exploration, and integration logic.

### Domain: Testing with GitHub Copilot
### Question 41
**Correct Answers: A and C**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Business and
Enterprise plans offer configuration settings that allow administrators to disable code
snippet retention. This ensures that sensitive code is not used for future model
improvements, aligning with organisational compliance needs.

- **Option C is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot Enterprise offers
the most advanced administrative features, including telemetry control, policy
enforcement, and integration with enterprise-level identity providers. These features
are critical for scaling Copilot responsibly across teams.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot Individual is designed
only for personal use and does not offer any centralised or admin-level privacy
controls. Each user manages their settings, which is insufficient for teams requiring
organisation-wide policy enforcement.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Privacy protections, such as
not using private code for training, are not automatically enabled in all SKUs. In some
plans, users or admins must explicitly configure these settings. This setting is known
as content exclusions.

**Reference:**

### Domain: Testing with GitHub Copilot
### Question 42
**Correct Answers: B and D**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because Admins can configure Copilot to
block suggestions that match public code, especially when code is found in open-source
repositories under certain licenses. This feature helps reduce compliance risks and
ensures proprietary code is not mixed with externally sourced patterns.

- **Option D is CORRECT** because at the organisation level, GitHub
administrators can enable or disable Copilot code suggestions for all users, or specific
repositories, using centralised configuration. This helps in enforcing consistent policy
across teams and projects.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because although developers can adjust
some local settings, they cannot override organisation-enforced restrictions, especially
those set by GitHub Enterprise admins. Admin-level configurations take precedence to
maintain policy compliance.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because although GitHub Copilot
Enterprise supports bringing in internal documentation to enrich Copilot Chat, it does
not allow admins to upload private datasets or codebases to directly influence or force
code completion suggestions. Copilot’s code suggestions remain driven by its base model,
contextual analysis, and optional organisation-wide filters, not by training on private
repositories.

### Domain: Testing with GitHub Copilot
### Question 43
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because the editor's settings file
(commonly “settings.json” in editors like VS Code) is where developers can manage GitHub
Copilot preferences, including which programming languages Copilot should be enabled or
disabled for. This allows fine-grained control and personal customisation directly in
the development environment.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not use or
recognise any manually created configuration script named specifically for Copilot. Its
behaviour is not controlled through custom project files.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because you do not need to contact
GitHub support for individual user preferences. As developers have full access to
configure Copilot locally within their editor settings.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Repository workflows or CI/CD
pipeline files cannot be used to control GitHub Copilot's suggestions or language
preferences inside the code editor. These are unrelated to Copilot's operation during
coding sessions.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 44
**Correct Answer: D**

- **Option D is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot responds to the
context and intent of the code. Writing descriptive comments like “//unit test for login
validation” or clear function names like “test_user_authentication()” helps Copilot
generate accurate boilerplate code for the specified test type. This enhances
productivity and aligns the generated structure with best practices.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because manually copying and renaming
test files is not leveraging Copilot’s AI capabilities. This approach increases the risk
of outdated patterns and may lead to missing out on Copilot’s efficiency in generating
fresh boilerplate tailored to the current code.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because although Copilot offers
suggestions by default, not providing context about the type of test leads to generic or
unrelated code. Prompting Copilot correctly is essential for generating meaningful
boilerplate code.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because while GitHub Copilot is highly
capable, it relies on context, such as file content, comments, and function names, to
generate meaningful suggestions. Leaving a file empty and expecting high-quality test
generation without offering any context or guidance will often lead to generic or
irrelevant suggestions.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 45
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot is designed to
analyse the local context within a file, which includes the test method’s name, any
descriptive comments, variable names, and nearby logic. Using this context, it can
intelligently suggest assertion statements that match the behaviour being tested. This
context-aware behaviour allows developers to write meaningful tests faster, focusing on
the logic rather than spending time on boilerplate assertion code.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not run
your code or connect to live environments. It does not execute any test case or retrieve
dynamic data from any external APIs. It only provides static suggestions at the time of
code writing, based on the given context and the patterns it has learned during
training. While its suggestions may feel intelligent, they are not runtime-generated or
validated.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not try to modify
or rewrite any part of your source modules to force test coverage. It always respects
the developer's control over the code and offers non-intrusive suggestions. It can help
you write test code around a module, but it won’t change the module itself to increase
assertion points or logic coverage automatically.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because while GitHub Copilot is trained
on public code repositories, it does not insert generic or trending assertions without
user knowledge. It won’t copy-paste from popular projects. Instead, it uses the context
present in the current file or the surrounding open tabs to tailor its suggestions.
Ignoring local code context would lead to irrelevant or potentially incorrect
assertions, which is not how Copilot performs its job of generating relevant
suggestions.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 46
**Correct Answers: A and C**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot can detect when a
developer attempts to write a risky pattern, like constructing SQL queries using the
string concatenation method. Based on this context, it may suggest safer approaches such
as parameterised queries. This approach of GitHub Copilot reduces the risk of SQL
injection. This is part of its ability to promote secure coding practices by drawing
from its extensive training data on better patterns.

- **Option C is CORRECT** because Copilot often identifies
situations like hardcoded passwords or secrets and can recommend using secure
environment variables or libraries designed for credential management. It also avoids
insecure functions and can direct developers towards more secure alternatives when it
detects risky usage patterns.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not perform
runtime or dynamic analysis. It operates only during development and cannot scan
deployed services or monitor real-time threats like a runtime application security tool
(RAST) or a WAF (Web Application Firewall) might. These facilities need the Engineers to
utilize the third-party tools.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not block code
execution or act like a policy enforcer. While it may suggest more modern libraries or
provide a warning against deprecated practices, it does not prevent developers from
using outdated packages.

- **Option E is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not have the
direct capability to encrypt data fields or apply code changes. It may suggest
encryption-related code if prompted clearly, but it does not infer sensitive data purely
from file or variable names and act on it autonomously.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 47
**Correct Answers: B and D**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot can suggest
simpler and cleaner ways to structure your code, especially when dealing with repetitive
loops or unnecessary conditions. These suggestions help improve performance and
readability by reducing computational overhead and eliminating redundant operations.

- **Option D is CORRECT** because Copilot is trained on a huge
amount of data consisting of high-quality public code. It uses this knowledge to offer
efficient solutions that mirror best practices seen in real-world, optimised codebases.
These suggestions help developers write code that’s both faster and more maintainable.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because GitHub Copilot does not run or
monitor performance tests on its own. It cannot analyse execution speed or independently
modify code based on performance metrics without an input from the user end. Its role is
limited to suggesting based on static context.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because Copilot does not recommend
drastic shifts like switching to an entirely different programming language, especially
without considering factors like compliance, team expertise, or project constraints.
Such decisions fall under architectural planning and are beyond Copilot’s automated
capabilities. This approach also violates the responsible AI principles.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 48
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because GitHub Copilot offers
organisation-level and repository-level content exclusion settings, which allow admins
to specify that certain code should not be included to improve Copilot’s underlying
model. This ensures privacy and compliance without disabling Copilot entirely. These
settings are part of GitHub Enterprise administrative controls.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because there is no .copilotignore file
that controls Copilot suggestions. GitHub Copilot does not respect .gitignore or any
similar exclusion file for training purposes. This option was just placed as a
distractor.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because disabling Copilot completely
would block all developers from using it. This isn't necessary if the goal is just to
exclude certain content from being shared or used for backend model improvement.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because Comments like “#private” in
code do not affect Copilot's training pipeline or its suggestion behaviour. GitHub uses
explicit exclusion settings for such use cases, not code annotations.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 49
**Correct Answer: B**

- **Option B is CORRECT** because this statement misrepresents how
exclusions function. Content exclusions do not globally disable Copilot’s functionality
for all files. Rather, they stop Copilot from learning from or generating suggestions
based on the specific excluded content. Developers can still receive real-time
suggestions and use chat capabilities in non-excluded files.

- **Option A is INCORRECT** because excluding critical files can
lead to a loss of context, which directly impacts Copilot’s ability to generate accurate
and helpful code completions. This trade-off is expected when prioritising privacy over
suggestion quality and is technically correct.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because this statement accurately
reflects GitHub documentation. Excluded files are not used to inform suggestions in
other parts of the codebase, nor do they impact Copilot Chat responses. This helps
prevent potential leakage of sensitive content.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because even if a file is excluded,
some IDEs (like VS Code) might still pass along semantic metadata such as type hints,
definitions, or symbol info from that file to the Copilot engine, indirectly impacting
suggestions. So this description is also technically valid.

### Domain: Privacy fundamentals and content exclusions
### Question 50
**Correct Answer: A**

- **Option A is CORRECT** because this is the accurate and
recommended method. GitHub provides an option at the organisation level to prevent
prompt and suggestion collection by disabling the setting “Allow GitHub to use code
snippets for product improvements.” This setting helps organisations stay compliant with
data protection policies while continuing to use Copilot.

- **Option B is INCORRECT** because Disabling GitHub Copilot
entirely prevents all usage of Copilot, but is not a fine-tuned approach for just
turning off telemetry. This is an ineffective method that may interrupt developer
productivity unnecessarily.

- **Option C is INCORRECT** because although individual developers
can manage some local settings, telemetry preferences are governed at the organisation
level, especially in enterprise or business subscriptions. Changing “settings.json” may
not fully prevent telemetry collection.

- **Option D is INCORRECT** because removing licenses disables
access to Copilot altogether, but it is not a method to configure prompt and suggestion
collection. It removes functionality, not just telemetry. This statement is contextually
invalid.
